## Dataset

>  WeRateDogs Twitter Analysis: This project was done using Python. Initially, the dataset were gathered before the cleaning process begun. 
One is the Twitter archived Data which was pre-gathered for this project. The second dataset was to be downloaded programmatically using python then the content were stored in a text file.
The last dataset which is needed to provide additional information on the tweets such as its number of retweets and number of favorites (Likes) was gotten from Twitter API using Tweepy. 

The datasets in this project has gone through the following steps:

Step 1: Gathering data

Step 2: Assessing data

Step 3: Cleaning data

Step 4: Storing data

Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

Step 6: Reporting

## Summary of Findings

> Once the files were ready, I read them into a dataframe and visually assessed them using both python and excel. I did this to check if the data was clean, that is the quality and tidiness of the data. 
Since visually assessing data is not enough, I went ahead and programmatically accessed data. 
After assessing the data, I found it to be untidy as data types were wrong, there were missing data, wrong data,multiple columns that were meant to be a single column.
I stated cleaning, after making a copy of all dataframes. I cleaned the name columns by replacing None to NaN, the acceptable input for missing values. 
I also found some likely names and replaced the wrong names with them. 
I changed the columns that had data type as integer to string as they were not for calculation but identification. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I looked for the most popular dog names, the most tweeted dog stages and as it was a competition, I also looked out for the dog that had the highest like.Â¶
